# BLOWFISH_ALGORITHM
Blowfish encryption algorithm, a symmetric key block cipher known for its simplicity and security.

Blowfish operates on 64-bit
blocks and supports key lengths ranging from 32 to 448 bits. This implementation
includes key generation, encryption, and the core Blowfish operations, such as
the Feistel function and the P-array and S-boxes initialization. Through test cases
and comparison with a reference Java implementation,(GFG) the code demonstrates the
correctness and reliability of the Blowfish encryption algorithm in a simplified form.
Blowfishâ€™s flexibility and efficiency make it a valuable choice for various secure data
encryption applications.

# IMAGE ENCRYPTION USING BLOWFISH ALGORITHM 
Developed a application for Image Encryption and Decryption. The Folder IMAGE_ENCRYPTION consists the files
give the password.jpg as input or you can replace with any other jpg/jpeg file. the code processesss and saves the following files
(Compressed_password.jpg, encode.bin, cipher.txt, decrpted_password.jpg) which are uploaded to the folder for reference. Make sure the jpg/jpeg and py/ipynb are in the same directory
